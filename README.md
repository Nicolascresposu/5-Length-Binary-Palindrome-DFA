# Binary Palindrome DFA (5-Length)
A Java implementation of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that recognizes 5-digit binary palindromes.
-------------

## Overview

This project implements a DFA that specifically recognizes 5-digit binary palindromes (strings that read the same forwards and backwards). While DFAs cannot recognize arbitrary-length palindromes (which require a pushdown automaton), they can recognize fixed-length palindromes with a carefully designed state machine.
